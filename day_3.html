			<h3>Day_3</h3>
			<h4>DL838 BA [Hons]Film + Television Production</h4>
			<h5>Describe your day</h5>
			<p>
				I showed up to the TV studio set at around 10, and Dave from the staff
				showed me the cameras and different lighting techniques. All day, they
				were setting up for a rehearsal for the TV show they were making. Soon
				after, I headed up to the gallery, and the students showed me around.
				From the gallery, I watched the first rehearsal and observed how the
				gallery and director affected what was happening downstairs. After the
				break, I went back up to the gallery. Later on, I was asked to go back
				down to the studio. In the studio, I was made into one of the guests on
				their game show, so I got a taste of acting. It was really fun!
			</p>

			<h5>Activities</h5>
			<p>Camera and light setup gallery work acting test</p>

			<h5>What did you learn?</h5>
			<p>
				I learned how to use cameras and lights effectively . I also learned
				what the director and gallery does during a shoot.
